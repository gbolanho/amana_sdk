# AMANA SDK Hub 💧

Welcome to the internal engine room of **Amana Games**, an independent game development studio based in Brazil. 🇧🇷

The **AMANA SDK Hub** is our custom-built orchestration layer, designed to streamline our development workflow for our flagship project: **Ainimonia**. We believe that high-end game development requires high-end tooling, and this Hub is the bridge between our creative vision and our technical stack.

## 🚀 Our Stack

At Amana Games, we stand on the shoulders of giants while carving our own path. Our workflow is built around powerful open-source tools that we've adapted and forked to suit the unique needs of **Ainimonia**.

### 🎮 Ainimonia
Our main project. A journey into a deep, immersive world currently being forged using the Godot Engine. The Hub manages the project lifecycle, ensuring the latest builds and editor versions are always ready for action.

### 📐 TRENCH (TrenchBroom Fork)
TrenchBroom is an incredible level editor originally for Quake. We've adopted it as our primary level design tool. Through our **TRENCH** implementation, we bring the speed and precision of "old-school" brush-based geometry into a modern Godot-centered workflow. It's fast, tactile, and essential for our architectural design.

### 📦 BLOCK (Model Editor)
**BLOCK** is our specialized model editor (a sophisticated fork of Blockbench/Electron-based tooling) tailored for the Amana Games aesthetic. It allows us to iterate rapidly on character models, props, and animations with a seamless bridge into our Godot pipeline.

### 🤖 GODOT Engine
We utilize the **Godot Engine 4.6 Stable (Vanilla)** to power Ainimonia’s world. The Hub ensures that every developer on the team is running the exact same binary and configuration for a unified creative process.

## ✨ Features of the Hub

-   **One-Click Setup**: Synchronizes the entire development environment (Editors + Project Source) automatically.
-   **Smart Launchers**: Handles complex launch parameters for different tools (e.g., Godot Editor mode vs. Game Debug mode).
-   **System Diagnostics**: Real-time monitoring of hardware (GPU, CPU, VRAM) to ensure optimal performance during development.
-   **Cross-Platform (mostly)**: Built with Flutter to support our Windows and Linux (Ubuntu-first) developers.

## 💪 Amana Games: Small Studio, Big Vision

Being an indie studio in Brazil doesn't stop us from pushing the boundaries of what's possible in the open-source ecosystem. We invest heavily in our internal tools because we know that a refined **Developer Experience (DX)** leads to a superior **Player Experience (PX)**.

This Hub is more than just a launcher; it's a statement of our commitment to technical excellence and professional game production.
